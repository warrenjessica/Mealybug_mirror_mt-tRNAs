EdgeR was used for differential abundance analysis on mapped YAMAT reads from the three mitochondrial isolations compared to the three total insect samples. Raw reads can be found at the sequence read archive (SRA):BioSample accession (SAMN53361679)

Read counts per tRNA reference were generated was done with the yamat_blast_parse_v.4_strand.pl script found in the YAMAT_read_processing directory. 
The counts for all mapped tRNA references used in this DE analysis can be found in the 75_strandcountmatrix_justTCME.txt file.
