All YAMAT reads can be downloaded from GenBank at (XXXXXX)

YAMAT reads are trimmed and merged with Read_processing.sh.
The Read_processing.sh script also calls the count_CCA.pl and collapsed_fasta_to_freq_dist.pl scripts found in this directory. Idential reads are collapsed with the fastx_collapser from the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/)

Processed reads were BLASTed to the reference tRNA database (pcitri_db_update3.fas) with blast.sh. 

Mapping of YAMAT reads to the reference tRNA database (pcitri_db_update3.fas) was done with the yamat_blast_parse_v.4_strand.pl script by parsing the BLAST output files. 

The yamat_blast_parse_v.4_strand.pl script was called as follows: 

perl yamat_blast_parse_v.4_strand.pl yamat_blast_summary.txt pcitri_db_update3.fas 1e-6 75_strand 0.75

Only reads with greater than 75% a query coverage hit to a database tRNA were counted for mapping. 

The yamat_blast_parse_v.4_strand.pl script has multiple output files, including a count matrix of all reads that map to each reference, a count matrix of how many reads have equally good hits to multiple references (ties), and a summary file with all BLAST information for each hit.
