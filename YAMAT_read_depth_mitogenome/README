YAMAT reads from the three mitochondrial isolate samples were mapped to the mitogenome using BLAST. 
The raw reads for the three mitochondrial isolate YAMAT replicates can be found at the sequence read archive (SRA) BioSample accession: SAMN53361679

The mitogenome (and BLAST database) was the final assemby file (assembly-I5_edit_final.fa) generated from the Mitogenome_assembly pipeline. 

Only YAMAT sequences with 2 or more reads were used in this analysis. After reads were BLASTED to the mitogenome, they were filtered
