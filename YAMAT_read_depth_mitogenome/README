YAMAT reads from the three mitochondrial isolate samples were mapped to the mitogenome using BLAST. 
The raw reads for these three files can be found at XXXX XXXX XXXX on genbank

The mitogenome (and BLAST database) was the final assemby file (assembly-I5_edit_final.fa) generated from the Mitogenome_assembly pipeline. 

Only YAMAT sequences with 2 or more reads were used in this analysis. After reads were BLASTED to the mitogenome, they were filtered
