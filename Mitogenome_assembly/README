Assembly of the P. citri mitogenome using Nanopore and Illumina reads. Sample libraries were prepared using the PCR-free Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-NBD114.24) with the NEBNext® Companion Module (E7180L) to manufacturer’s specifications. No additional DNA fragmentation or size selection was performed.
