Assembly of the P. citri mitogenome using Nanopore and Illumina reads. Sample libraries were prepared using the PCR-free Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-NBD114.24) with the NEBNext® Companion Module (E7180L) to manufacturer’s specifications. No additional DNA fragmentation or size selection was performed.

Nanopore (accession:SRR36142057) and Illumina (accession: ) reads have been deposited on GeneBank


perbase found two insertions of a T in homopolymers that were present in Illumina reads, but not in the Nanopore assembly. These insertions were added to the final mitogenome assembly and the assembly was renamed assembly-I5_EDIT.fasta and used for downstream analysis.
