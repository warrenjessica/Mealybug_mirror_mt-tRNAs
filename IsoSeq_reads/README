Isoseq reads were generated from bacteriome tissue and residual body tissue (insects with bacteriome removed) from P. citri. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol using manufacturer's protocol.

Bacteriomes were dissected from 

IsoSeq libraries were prepared using SMRTbell prep kit 3.0 (v02.2022). Pooled libraries underwent the PacBio binding and cleanup steps using the Revio Polymerase kit.

IsoSeq reads can be found under the following NCBI sample accession #s:
SAMN53396481 
SAMN53396482
SAMN53396479
SAMN53396480 

IsoSeq reads were trimmed using cutadapt (v5.1) and a custom python script (trim_polyA_sliding.py) with the isoseq_trim.sh script.
